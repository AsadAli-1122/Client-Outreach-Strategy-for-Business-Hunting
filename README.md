## **How to Avoid Spam in Cold Emailing**

âœ… **Warm up your account** (start with 10-20 emails/day, then increase)  
âœ… **Use personalized emails** (avoid copy-pasting the same text)  
âœ… **Use a professional domain** (instead of @gmail.com)  
âœ… **Track opens/replies** (use tools like Mailtrack or GMass)  
âœ… **Send emails in batches** (e.g., 20-30 per hour)  
âœ… **Ask for replies** (Gmail trusts accounts that get responses)

ðŸ”¹ **Best Practice:** Use a mix of **Gmail + Cold Email Tools (Brevo, Mailgun, etc.)** for higher volume and better deliverability.
