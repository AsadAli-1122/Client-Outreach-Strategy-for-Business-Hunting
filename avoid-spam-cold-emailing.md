# How to Avoid Spam in Cold Emailing

Cold emailing can be a powerful tool for client outreach, but emails that land in spam will never be seen. Follow these best practices to improve email deliverability and ensure your emails reach the inbox.

## ‚úÖ Warm Up Your Email Account
1. Start with 10-20 emails per day and gradually increase.
2. Avoid sudden spikes in sending volume to prevent spam flags.
3. Engage with real conversations (send test emails to friends/colleagues).
4. Use email warm-up tools like Lemwarm, GMass, or MailReach.

## ‚úÖ Use Personalized Emails
1. Avoid sending mass, copy-pasted emails.
2. Address the recipient by name and mention something specific about their business.
3. Use a conversational tone rather than a robotic or sales-heavy pitch.

## ‚úÖ Use a Professional Domain
1. Instead of using **@gmail.com**, get a business domain like **@yourcompany.com**.
2. Authenticate your domain with **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** settings.
3. Verify your email address before sending (use ZeroBounce or NeverBounce).

## ‚úÖ Track Email Opens & Replies
1. Use tools like Mailtrack, GMass, or Yesware to monitor email performance.
2. Adjust your email strategy based on open rates and responses.
3. Avoid re-sending to the same people without changes.

## ‚úÖ Send Emails in Batches
1. Avoid sending too many emails at once (20-30 per hour is safe).
2. Use automation tools with time delays between emails.
3. Spread emails throughout the day to mimic natural human behavior.

## ‚úÖ Ask for Replies & Engagement
1. Gmail and other providers trust accounts that get replies.
2. Ask questions or include a call-to-action that encourages a response.
3. Keep follow-ups simple and conversational.

## ‚ùå Avoid Spam Triggers
1. Don't use excessive capitalization (e.g., **FREE OFFER!!!**).
2. Avoid spammy words like "guaranteed," "limited time offer," or "buy now."
3. Keep your email signature simple and professional.

## ‚úÖ Follow Up Smartly
1. Send 2-3 follow-ups if there is no response.
2. Space follow-ups 3-5 days apart.
3. Change the subject line and add new value in each follow-up.

## ‚úÖ Use a Mix of Gmail & Cold Email Tools
1. **Gmail** is good for small-scale outreach (under 50 emails/day).
2. **Cold email tools** (Brevo, Mailgun, Woodpecker) are better for scaling.
3. Rotate multiple email accounts to avoid hitting sending limits.
