# **📧 How to Avoid Email Spamming**  

Ensuring your cold emails land in the recipient’s **inbox** (not the spam folder) is crucial for successful outreach. This guide covers best practices to improve email deliverability and avoid spam filters.

## **🚨 Why Do Emails Go to Spam?**  
Email providers use **spam filters** to block unwanted messages. Emails may be marked as spam if they:  
- Contain **spam-triggering words** (e.g., “Free,” “Act now”)  
- Are sent in bulk without personalization  
- Lack **proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)**  
- Have a **high bounce rate** or low engagement

## **🛠️ Best Practices to Avoid Spam Filters**  

### **✅ 1. Warm Up Your Email Account**  
- If using a new domain, **gradually increase email sending volume**.  
- Start with **10-20 emails/day** and scale up over **2-4 weeks**.  
- Use tools like **Mailwarm, Warmbox** for automation.  

### **✅ 2. Use a Professional Email Address**  
- Avoid **@gmail.com, @yahoo.com** for business emails.  
- Instead, use **yourname@yourcompany.com** for credibility.  

### **✅ 3. Authenticate Your Email Domain**  
Ensure your email domain is configured correctly:  
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** – Prevents spoofing.  
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** – Verifies message integrity.  
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)** – Protects your domain reputation.

### **✅ 4. Personalize Each Email**  
- Use the recipient’s **name and company**.  
- Avoid **mass emails** with generic content.  

### **✅ 5. Avoid Spam Trigger Words**  
- Certain words **increase the chance of emails landing in spam**.  
- Avoid words like **“Free,” “Guaranteed,” “Limited-time offer”**.  
- Check the full list in **[Email Spam Words to Avoid](./email-spam-words-to-avoid.md)**.  

### **✅ 6. Keep a Balanced Text-to-Link Ratio**  
- Too many **links in an email** can trigger spam filters.  
- Best practice: **1-2 links per email** (avoid shortened URLs).  

### **✅ 7. Maintain a Healthy Bounce Rate**  
- A **high bounce rate (>5%)** hurts your sender reputation.  
- Use **email verification tools** (e.g., ZeroBounce, NeverBounce) before sending.  

### **✅ 8. Encourage Replies**  
- Spam filters favor **two-way conversations**.  
- Ask an open-ended question to encourage responses.  

### **✅ 9. Optimize Sending Frequency**  
- **Best practice:** Send **20-30 emails per hour**, not all at once.  
- Avoid sending **hundreds of emails in one go**—it looks suspicious.  

### **✅ 10. Monitor Email Deliverability**  
- Use tools like **Mailtrap, GlockApps, or MXToolbox** to check inbox placement.  
- If emails land in spam, tweak your **content, domain, and sending strategy**.
